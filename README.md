# alexa-youtube-skill

By default, Amazon Alexa does not support playing audio from YouTube. In fact, it only supports a limited number of third-party audio-based skills (Spotify music is one of them). Otherwise, all default Alexa skills that use audio are tied almost exclusively to Amazon services.

__alexa-youtube-skill__ contains the code for an unpublished skill that allows users to search and play audio from YouTube. For example, a user might say:

"Alexa, search YouTube for Frost Hyperventilate." 

Alexa will then do a search, finding the most relevant video that matches the query (in this case, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol592sakmZU) and then will return and play the MP3 version of the video.
