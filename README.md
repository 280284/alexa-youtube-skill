# alexa-youtube-skill

By default, Amazon Alexa does not support playing audio from YouTube. In fact, it only supports a limited number of third-party audio-based skills like Spotify music. Otherwise, all default Alexa skills that use audio are tied almost exclusively to Amazon services. This project contains the code for an unpublished skill that allows users to search and play audio from YouTube. For example, a user might say:

> Alexa, search YouTube for Frost Hyperventilate.

This skill will then perform a search, finding [the most relevant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol592sakmZU) that matches the query. It will then stream the video's audio to your device.
